# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: improper error handling within route handlers, specifically when interacting with databases.

The `bug.js` file showcases a route handler that fetches user data from a database.  If the user is not found, a 404 status is returned. However, if any database error occurs (e.g., connection error, query error), the application does not gracefully handle it.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, incorporating robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and proper error response handling.
